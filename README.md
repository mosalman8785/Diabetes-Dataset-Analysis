# 🧠 Diabetes Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to diabetes using **Python** and powerful libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosammhmdali/diabetes-dataset)
- Columns:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
  - Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Replaced invalid zero values in critical columns (e.g., Glucose, BMI, BloodPressure).
- Created new categorical features (e.g., AgeGroup, BMICategory).
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed detailed analysis using:

- **Univariate plots**: histograms, pie charts
- **Bivariate plots**: scatter plots, box plots, violin plots
- **Correlation heatmap**
- **Group analysis by Outcome**

### 🔍 Example Visualizations

- Pie chart of diabetes outcome
- Glucose vs BloodPressure scatter plot
- BMI and Age impact on diabetes
- Box plot: SkinThickness vs Outcome

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Higher glucose levels are strongly associated with diabetes.
- Diabetic patients tend to have higher BMI and age.
- BloodPressure and Insulin levels show moderate trends.
- SkinThickness is slightly higher in diabetic patients.
